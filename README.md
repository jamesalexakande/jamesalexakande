### 👨‍💻 About Me

Ohayo Gozaimasu!;

I'm **James Akande**, a technical writer and documentation specialist passionate about making software more accessible through clear, concise, and user-focused content.

With a strong background in **PaaS, Banking & Finance, AI, and Blockchain**, I create:

- API documentation that enhances developer experience
- End-user manuals and guides that simplify complexity
- Technical articles that drive engagement and adoption
- Release notes that inform and empower users
- Documentation reviews that improve content quality

I work closely with **developers, designers,  product managers, and other subject-matter experts** to craft documentation that bridges the gap between **application complexity  and user needs**.  My aim is simple - create documentation that brings clarity, simplicity, and conciseness in everything I do. I constantly seek opportunities to use my skills and experience to contribute to the growth of companies creating innovative and disruptive products and services.

Currently, I’m **expanding my expertise to focus on  cloud, AI, and DevRel**, aiming to create even more impactful documentation and developer experiences. While much of what I do at my current role is proprietary, you can check out samples, past projects and other contributions here in my portfolio.
