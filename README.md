Ohayo Gozeimazu!

Iâ€™m James Akande, a technical writer and technical content marketer for SaaS, Banking/Finance and Web3. 

With experience in creating long-form technical articles, online help guides and tutorials, application user guides and manuals, release notes, and documentation reviews, I employ my knowledge of different tools and technologies and content management systems to create comprehensive and user-friendly documentation for SaaS and software products. Specializing in simplifying complex technical concepts, I excel in translating intricate technical details into clear and accessible content for diverse audiences.
 SaaS, and finance, with a focus on using good documentation and long-form technical content to bridge the clarity-complexity gap between tools and applications, and their technical/non-technical users.

As a technical writer, I constantly seek opportunities to use my skills and experience to contribute to the growth of companies creating innovative and disruptive products and services. I am eager to collaborate with internal teams in creating technical content and documentation that delivers simplicity, clarity, conciseness, and accessibility.

While a lot of what I do at my current role is proprietary, here you can find samples of past work, technical articles, as well as open-source projects I have contributed to.
