## Technical Writer | Writing documentation and technical content that bridge the gap between applications and users in SaaS, Web3 and Finance
----
Ohayo Gozeimazu!

I'm James Akande, a technical writer and content marketer specializing in SaaS, Banking/Finance, and Web3.

With experience in creating long-form technical articles, online help guides and tutorials, end- user guides and manuals, release notes, and documentation reviews, I aim to create clear and user-friendly software documentation. With experience in various tools and content management systems, I focus on producing content thatâ€™s both comprehensive and accessible, bridging the clarity-complexity gap between product owners and application managers, their tools and applications, and their non-technical users.

As a technical writer, I enjoy collaborating with teams to create content that bridges the gap between technical details and end users, ensuring clarity, simplicity, and conciseness in everything I do. I constantly seek opportunities to use my skills and experience to contribute to the growth of companies creating innovative and disruptive products and services. 

While much of what I do at my current role is proprietary, you can check out samples of past projects and open-source contributions here in my portfolio.
